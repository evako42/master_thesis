**Background**: Transcranial magnetic stimulation mapping of the muscle cortical representations is a valuable tool in clinic and research to measure changes in cortical representations. A common practice to obtain motor maps is to perform the grid mapping technique that is time-consuming and strenuous for patients. Recently, a much faster method, the pseudorandom walk method, has been developed that shows equal reliability compared to grid mapping. However, the reliability has been mainly investigated for hand muscles.

**Objective**: To examine the reliability of motor maps obtained with the pseudorandom walk of a proximal muscle, the Brachioradialis, and a hand muscle, the First Dorsal Interosseous. Additional objective is to describe the inter-hemispheric differences in motor map parameters of each muscle. 

**Method**: The pseudorandom walk method was used to obtain motor map area, volume, and center of gravity in both muscles. Twenty-two healthy subjects were tested four times over two separate days. Within- and between-session reliability was investigated for the right hemispheric motor map parameters of each muscle and motor map parameters were compared between hemispheres for both muscles. 

**Results**: The right hemispheric motor map parameters of both muscles showed high similarities over all sessions, confirming the reliability of the method to obtain proximal muscle motor maps. No inter-hemispheric differences in motor map parameters of both muscles were observed.

**Conclusions**: This study extends the reliability of the pseudorandom walk method to the proximal Brachioradialis muscle and brings this technique one step closer to being used in the clinic where patients would benefit greatly.
